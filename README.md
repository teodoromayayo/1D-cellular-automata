# 1D-cellular-automata
This codes calculate the dynamics of one dimensional cellular automatas and measure dynamical properties.

# Burnside's Lemma
There is a code provided which calculates the 88 inequivalent rules. They are caclulated in such a way that selects the rule with lowest langton parameter when applying transformations (identity, reflection, conjugation and both reflection and conjugations). In case there are rules with same langton parameter the rule with lowest number will be selected.
